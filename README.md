# NN_Project
This project aims to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits on the MNIST dataset.
In addition, we also plan to study automated hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in deep learning model tuning. Traditional methods such as Grid Search or Random Search are inefficient. We hope to explore automated hyperparameter optimization methods and compare the efficiency and accuracy in our CNN tuning.
